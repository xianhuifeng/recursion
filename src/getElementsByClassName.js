// If life was easy, we could just do things the easy way:
/*var getElementsByClassName = function (className) {
  return document.getElementsByClassName(className);
};
*/

// But instead we're going to implement it from scratch:
var getElementsByClassName = function(className){
  var results = [];

  //get all ancestor nodes in the page

  //recur start
  
  //in each ancestor node, check to see if has child node

  	//if has not child, see if it has class name

  		//if has, store that node into result
  		//return

  	//if has child, call recur(childnode)
  return results;
};
